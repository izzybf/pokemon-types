## Single Type Pokemon

## Dual Type Pokemon

Some generation 1 pokemon have two elemental types. This makes it trickier to decide what pokemon to use against them.

## Immunities

Some pokemon types are completely immune to elemental attacks from specific types.
- Ground immune to electric
- Flying immune to ground
- Ghost immune to normal and fighting
- Normal and fighting immune to ghost

## Team Building

An ideal team in pokemon will have a variety of elemental types to deal with each type you might encounter. Many pokemon can learn moves of a different elemental type, so pokemon with a large moveset are important.
